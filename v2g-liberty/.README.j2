# V2G Liberty: Automated and optimised vehicle-to-grid charging

This add-on lets you add full automatic and optimised control over bidirectional charging of your electric
vehicle (EV), also known as Vehicle to Grid (V2G). It is a practical app based on home assistant frontend that works in
the browser and on your phone.

The schedules are optimised to maximise revenues Ã³r minimising emissions. The optimisations are handled by
[FlexMeasures](https://flexmeasures.io/).

## Pre-requisites
+ Currently this software only works with the Wallbox Quasar 1 charger.<br>
  We expect to support new chargers soon. The battery electric vehicle of course must support bidirectional charging.
+ An electricity contract with dynamic prices.<br>
  In the European Union this usually is based on day-ahead prices, our schedules accommodate for these. One can also
  self provide the price data through V2G Liberty, so any dynamic energy contract is supported.
+ A FlexMeasures account.<br>
  You can self-host FlexMeasures or [request a subscription](https://v2g-liberty.eu/?pagename=contact) to one on our
  servers.
+ An online calendar (e.g. NextCloud, OwnCloud, Google, Apple iCloud, etc.)
