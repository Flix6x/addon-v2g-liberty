#############   CAR & POWER-CONNECTION CONFIGURATION   #########################
## ALWAYS CHECK/CHANGE ##

# The usable energy storage capacity of the battery of the car, as an integer.
# For the Nissan Leaf this is usually 21, 39 or 59 (advertised as 24, 40 and 62).
# See https://ev-database.org.
# Use an integer between 10 and 200.
car_max_capacity_in_kwh: 59

# What would you like to be the minimum charge in your battery?
# The scheduling will not discharge below this value and if the car returns with
# and SoC below this value, the battery will be charged to this minimum asap
# before regular scheduling.
# A high value results in always having a greater driving range available, even
# when not planned, but less capacity available for dis-charge and so lesser
# earnings.
# A lower value results in sometimes a smaller driving range available for
# un-planned drives but there is always more capacity for discharge and so more
# earnings.
# Some research suggests battery life is shorter if min SoC is below 15%.
# In some cars the SoC sometimes skips a number, e.g. from 21 to 19%,
# skipping 20%. This might result in toggling charging behaviour around this
# minimum SoC. If this happens try a value 1 higher or lower.
# The setting must be an integer (without the % sign) between 10 and 30, default is 20.
car_min_soc_in_percent: 20

# What would you like to be the maximum charge in your car battery?
# The schedule will use this for regular scheduling. It can be used to further
# protect the battery from degradation as a 100% charge (for longer periods) may
# reduce battery health/lifetime.
# When a calendar item is present, the schedule will ignore this setting and
# try to charge to 100% (or if the calendar item has a target use that).
# A low setting reduces schedule flexibility and so the capability to earn
# money and reduce emissions.
# The setting must be an integer value between 60 and 100, default is 80.
car_max_soc_in_percent: 80

# When the car connects with a SoC higher than car_max_soc_in_percent
# how long may the schedule take to bring the SoC back to this maximum?
# A longer duration gives opportunity for higher gains but might have a (minor)
# degradation effect on the battery.
# This duration is excluding the (minimum) time it takes to get back to the
# desired maximum under normal cycling conditions.
# The setting must be an integer value between 2 and 36, default is 12.
allowed_duration_above_max_soc_in_hrs: 12

# What is the average electricity usage of your car in watt-hour (Wh) per km?
# In most cars you can find historical data in the menu's. Normally this is somewhere
# between 140 (very efficient!) and 300 (rather in-efficient vans).
# Make sure you use the right "unit of measure": Wh.
# The setting must be an integer value.
car_average_wh_per_km: 174

# Max (dis-)charge_power in Watt
#   Be safe:
#   Please consult a certified electrician what max power can be set on
#   the charger. Electric safety must be provided by the hardware. Limits for over
#   powering must be guarded by hardware.
#   This software should not be the only fail-safe.
#   It is recommended to use a load balancer.
#
# If a load balancer (power-boost for WB) is used:
# Set this to "Amperage setting in charger" * grid voltage.
# E.g. 25A * 230V = 5750W.
# If there is no load balancer in use, use a lower setting.
# Usually the discharge power is the same but in some cases the charger or
# (gird operator) regulations require a different (lower) dis-charge power.
